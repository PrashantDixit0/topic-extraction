# From Calls to Insights: Topic Extraction from Contact CenterÂ Calls
1. The extraction graph creates an endpoint which accepts audio files and transcribes them using OpenAI's Whisper model
2. The transcription is fed into an LLM for Topic Extraction.
3. The transcription is fed into a summarization model to summarize the entire transcript.

## Code Reference
1. `graph.yaml` - contains the extraction graph.
2. `setup_graph.py` - Sets up the extraction graph in Indexify Server
3. `upload_and_retrieve.py` - Uploads audio into the extraction graph, waits for extraction and finally retrieves from the endpoint.
